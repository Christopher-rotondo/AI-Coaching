### **1.1 Overview**

**Project Description & Objectives**

Our project is an **AI Coaching App** designed to help users effectively **set and achieve goals** by leveraging proven habit-formation science and personalized AI-driven recommendations. Instead of letting social media distractions dominate attention, we introduce a system that **gamifies goal achievement** with features like monetary deposits for accountability, streak tracking, and AI-based task breakdown.

**Intended Audience**

- Students, professionals, or hobbyists aiming to **build consistent habits** or complete specific goals (e.g., finishing a course, writing a book, developing a new skill).
- Anyone who struggles with **procrastination** or **distractions** and wants a **structured**, AI-assisted approach to stay on track.

**Primary Goals & Motivations**

1. **Create a More Compelling Alternative** to social media by making **goal pursuit “addictive”** in a positive sense.
2. **Leverage Theories Like Atomic Habits & Deep Work** to ensure users form **tiny, consistent improvements** and **focused work blocks**.
3. **Encourage Accountability & Engagement** through **financial stakes** (loss aversion) and community support.
